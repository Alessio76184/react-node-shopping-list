- Add, edit, and delete shopping list items
- Fully automated UI and API tests

## 💠 Setup Instructions

From the project root:
```bash 
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

## ▶️ Running the App

### Start the Backend
```bash 
cd backend
node server.js
```

### Start the Frontend (with HTTP)

HTTPS=false npm start
```

Visit: http://localhost:3000

## ✅ Running the Tests

### API Tests (Jest + Supertest)

# Test Plan — Shopping List App

## 📋 Scope

- POST /login: Valid and invalid credentials
- GET /items: Returns current list
- POST /items: Adds item
- PUT /items/:id: Edits item
- DELETE /items/:id: Deletes item

### 2. UI (Functional)

- Login (success/failure)
- Add new item
- Edit existing item
- Delete item
- Assert correct data is rendered

## 🏃 How to Run Tests

### API Tests
```bash 
cd backend
npm test
```

### UI Tests (Playwright)
Ensure both frontend and backend are running, then:
```bash
cd ..
npx playwright test
```

# From project root
```bash
npx playwright test
```

> ⚠️ **N.B. Make sure both backend and frontend are running before running Playwright.**

## 💾 Assumptions & Limitations

- No persistent database; data resets on restart
- Auth is mocked and insecure (demo only)
- Only tested on local machine (Chrome)
